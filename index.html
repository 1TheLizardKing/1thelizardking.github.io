                        <h4>1. The only non four sided flag</h4>
                        The only national flag to not be four sided is the flag of Nepal, which is in fact in the shape of two triangles stacked upon one another.</p>
                
                    <p>
                        <h4>2. Reverse flags</h4>The flags of Saudi Arabia, Moldova and Paraguay differ on their reverse side in comparison to the front side. The front side of the Moldovan flag conains the coat of arms, whereas the reverse side of the Paraguayan flag contains a treasury seal. The Saudi Arabian flag is often two flags sewn together as the arabic text and sword upon the flag is sacred, so is duplicated on the reverse side.</p>

                    <p> <h4>3. World's largest flag</h4>
                        The largest flag ever made is considered to be the romanian flag, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. The flag was an astonishing 349 x 227 metres!</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <h4>4. Sqaure flags </h4>
                        The flags of the Vatican city and Switzerland are the only national flags that are sqaure.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h4>5. Thank the saxons!</h4>
                        The use of flags can be dated back to assyrian times as it is believed that they were paraded in battle. The word "flag" itsef however is derived from the saxon word "flaken", which was used to describe an object that was seen flying in the wind. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h4>6. Wartime flag changes</h4>
                        Whilst there are a multitude of reasons a country can change their flag, the Philippines actually flip their flag upisde down depending on whether the country is at war or not. The filipino flag will have it's blue side up during peace times then will flip to have the red side up when at war.

                    <p>
                        <h4>7. The oldest flag</h4>
                        The oldest national flag is considered to be that of Denmark's, which was first seen in 1219 but has been in constant use since 1625.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h4>8. Feeling "purple" ?</h4>
                        Although it has been a colour associated with royalty for some time, the colour purple is hardly featured on the vast majority of national flags. The flags of Dominica and Nicaragua contain minimal amounts of purple, but that's it!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h4>9. Mistaken identity</h4>
                        There has been multiple occasions where countries have similar (Netherlands and Luxembourg), if not identical (Chad and Romania), flags and neither country has any idea. At the summer olympics of 1936, both Haiti and Liechtenstein were shocked to find out that their flags were pretty much the same.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <h4>10. From Antwerp to Sydney</h4>
                        The famous 5 ringed olympic flag was famously stolen at the 1920 Antwerp olympics, but it was later revealed that the culprit was actually one the competing athletes! In 1997, American olympian Hal Haig Prieste admitted in an interview (at 101 years old!) that he in fact stole the original olympic flag. The original flag was returned for use in Sydney at the 2000 olympics.
